# JavaFactoryPattern
Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. 
This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This example demonstrates Factory Design pattern using the same Burger example like the 
Decoratr pattern but this creates different burgers like Hamburger, cheeseburger and others and then applies the decorator pattern to it.
